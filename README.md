# Tourism-using-AugmentedReality

The application of Augmented Reality in tourism
We aim to build a mobile-based application that enhances the experience of urban tourism in India.  


During the corona days we were missing out of wandering outside and traveling tourism places so for having the virtual experience we need this kind of app which can give us virtual traveling experience.
Our Objective is to build a feature which displays unsplash free photos collection in a VR mode.
There are a ton of really interesting developments happening in the VR space right now and some are even focused on the web, which is awesome!
It will increase/promote Virtual Booking Interface, Virtual Travel Experiences.
It can be useful to educate historical events to students by learning over VR devices.
It is an instant as well as an easily accessible source of information for tourists about numerous historical monuments and areas - by just pointing their phone camera towards it. This would provide information such as cultural heritage, artistic, historical, political, technical and architectural importance
Currently, in the app when the "simulate VR" toggle is active, the scene renders full screen and utilizes mouse movement to simulate the head tracking of a VR headset.
