# Tourism-using-AugmentedReality

The application of Augmented Reality in tourism
We aim to build a mobile-based application that enhances the experience of urban tourism in India.  We would take advantage of Augmented Reality technology to show in real-time the unfinished, broken and damaged monuments in their original, untouched states on their phone screens when their camera is pointed at such an object. We will also provide our users with the opportunity of experiencing events unique to that place or area, whether they are ancient customs and traditions or even urban celebrations. Examples of such events are - On republic day and independence day- the unique lighting of the India Gate, Victoria terminus and Gateway of India as well as the parade on Rajpath.



AR+GPS Location




This asset enables us to place 3D objects in geographical positions defined by their latitude, longitude and altitude. 
Using this asset, we can create and place monuments in their required locations for the users to see when this feature is enabled.
